        <div class="AboutMe-container">
            <p>Hello! I’m Krithik Dhandapani, a passionate game developer and software engineer currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in Game Development.

                I love creating engaging and dynamic gaming experiences that combine strong mechanics, intuitive design, and immersive storytelling. My portfolio highlights projects built with tools like Unity and C#, showcasing my ability to craft everything from gameplay systems to polished user interfaces.
                
                Beyond the technical side, I strive for quality, simplicity, and elegance in every project I undertake. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, collaborating with other developers, and exploring creative ways to bring fresh ideas to life.
                
                When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me playing games for inspiration, keeping up with the latest tech trends, or refining my craft in both design and development.</p>
