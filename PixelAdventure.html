                Pixel Adventure is a simple-styled single player game implemented using JavaScript and the Phaser game framework. The game contains 3 levels that the player must overcome in order to complete the game. Each level has the option to be replayed or continue to the next level.
            The game contains animations and sound effects for player movement such as running, jumping, collecting coins, and a few other fun components. A physics system is in place in order for the player to complete actions such as crossing bridges, climbing trees, etc. 
        This game was my attempt at a 2D platformer, and as someone who is a huge fan of Super Mario Bros, I enjoyed the journey of developing this game a lot and am looking forward to working on more games using Phaser and Javascript.             </p>
