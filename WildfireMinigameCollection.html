                This collection of minigames was developed by a me and a team at UC Santa Cruz in collaboration with partners at UC Berkeley and UC Davis and with community partners in Marin and Alameda counties. 
                We were supported by a grant from the NSF under Smart and Connected Communities. The purpose of the games is to educate players on the dangers of wildfires and how to be the most prepared for them. 
                Having the right knowledge about wildfire safety can save money, property, and most importantly, lives. As one of the only two programmers for this project, I developed mechanics and a lot of the functionality you will see in the game.
                I also contributed to a lot of the user testing, bug reports, and quality analysis.

       </p>
       <p>
        These games have been built and deployed for the public on itch.io!
