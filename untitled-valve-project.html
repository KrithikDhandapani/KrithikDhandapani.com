                As uncreative as the project title is, this game was full of ideas and components that we had never messed around with before but were ready to dive right in. With a team of 4 other students, we spent about 4 months creating a 3D FPS game using the Unity Engine.
                 The basis of the game revolves around the player trying to escape a dungeon while fighting off enemies that try to keep them from leaving. We implemented intense sound and lighting effects to create a more spooky vibe, enemy agents that follow waypoints while patrolling, a dynamic inventory system for the player to pick up weapons, keys, etc. We also implemented a crafting system that the player can use to upgrade their weapons.
                 However, all of these features require the player to move around the map and collect the necessary components. This ultimately resulted in us creating a very hands-on and interactable game            </p>
