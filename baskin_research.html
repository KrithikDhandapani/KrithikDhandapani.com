                As an LLM Logic Researcher, my team and I specialize in exploring and analyzing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. 
                My work involves designing, testing, and evaluating logical frameworks, algorithms, and datasets to assess how well these models perform in 
                tasks requiring deductive and abductive reasoning. I investigate their ability to understand and generate valid logical inferences, 
                debug errors in their reasoning processes, and improve their interpretability and decision-making. My role includes developing experiments 
                to benchmark LLMs, crafting custom prompts, and collaborating on solutions that enhance their logical consistency and reliability.
